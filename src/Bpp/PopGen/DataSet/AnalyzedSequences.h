 * @brief The AnalyzedSequences class.
 *
 * This is a class to store info about the sequences.
 *
 * The object stores a pointer toward a const Alphabet.
 * The way the pointer is managed depend on the method used to set it.
 *
 * If one use a method using a const Alphabet* to set the Alphabet, then he
 * has to take care of the memory management (i.e. freeing the Alphabet
 * object).
 *
 * If one use a method that create an Alphabet object like those using a
 * string description of the Alphabet then the AnalyzedSequences object will
 * delete himself the Alphabet object on destruction.
 *
 * Be carefull when copying an AnalyzedSequences object, the way that the
 * Alphabet object is managed is also copyed then if the initial
 * AnalyzedSequences takes care of its Alphabet member then the copy will hold
 * copy af the Alphabet an manage it else the new AnalyzedSequences will just
 * copy the pointer and it's up to the user to take care of its deletion.
