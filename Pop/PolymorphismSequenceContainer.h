 * @par
 * The PopGenLib library provides classes for population genetics analysis.
 * It makes intensive use of the SeqLib library, and adds a dedicated container
 * named bpp::PolymorphismSequenceContainer, which associates frequencies to the
 * sequences in the set. The bpp::PolymorphismSequenceContainerTools and 
 * bpp::SequenceStatistics static classes provide several tools for data analysis,
 * including diversity indices and positive selection tests.
 *
 * @section dataset Population and sample data storage and manipulation
 *
 * @par
 * PopGenLib library provides data structure for handling sample and data sets
 * for population genetics.
 * These objects are embedded in the bpp::DataSet object which is a container of bpp::Group
 * of bpp::Individual.
 * Each bpp::Individual can store bpp::Sequence data or allelic data with the dedicated
 * classes bpp::MultilocusGenotype.
 *
 * @section genetics Population genetics data and statistics
 *
 * @par
 * To compute statistics on data, two containers families are provided, one for sequences
 * (bpp::PolymorphismSequenceContainer) and the other for allelic data (bpp::PolymorphismMultiGContainer).
 * Static tools class for both families are provided to compute several common or less
 * common statistics.
